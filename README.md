DREAMS AND TEA LEAVES, mixes the art of divination with the science of corporate IT. In this game, you play a young person who’s been given a shot at a job with the hottest new tech company, Ubiquity Incorporated, thanks to a favor from your ex’s current BF (how could that possibly go wrong?). Your challenge is to use your new-found fortune-telling skills, your investigative intuition, and your powers of logical deduction to figure out what’s going wrong with their computer systems and who (if anyone) is responsible.
