# cup-full-of-clues
CUP FULL OF CLUES, mixes the art of divination with the science of corporate IT. In this interactive text game, you play a young person starting their first real job. Sure, there's a trial period, but working for the hottest new tech company, Ubiquity Incorporated should be a real resume booster (no need to mention that you only got the job thanks to your ex's current boyfriend). Use your new-found fortune-telling skills, your investigative intuition, and your powers of logical deduction to figure out whatâ€™s going wrong with the Ubiquity computer systems and collar the culprit.

Made with the Choice of Games engine.
