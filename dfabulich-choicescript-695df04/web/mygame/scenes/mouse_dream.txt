That night, you fall asleep to the sound of Mischief chasing his tail up and down the hallways. You dream that you’re a black cat, pacing around a treasure chest, on guard. Mice dressed as pirates try to fight their way past you, while mice dressed as ninjas sneak around behind you. You chase them all away, and the treasure chest bursts open, revealing a mouse dancing on a heap of gold coins.
*set dream_3_description "[b]Dream #3[/b] I was a black cat, defending a treasure chest from mouse pirates and mouse ninjas. I got rid of the attacking mice, but then another mouse was inside with the treasure."

You wake up feeling frazzled. Mischief barely opens an eye as you get dressed for work, but stalks over to see what you’re doing when you’re examining the tea leaves in your Virtual Teacup. [i]What should I pay attention to today?[/i] 

The clump of leaves is the shape of a waterfall. [i]Looks like a warning. Waterfalls, cascades, and avalanches - small errors can add up to big problems.[/i]

You decide to do a second divination. What do you ask?
*choice
	#What should I do to convince Jamie that I’m not a threat to his relationship with Bobby?
		*set housemate_relationship +1
		The clump of leaves looks like upturned hands. A display of honesty. [i]That probably doesn’t mean I should just tell him that his aftershave smells terrible.[/i]
		*goto ending
	#Rene’s been flirting with me. Should I pursue this possibility? 
		*set resist_colleague -1
		The clump of leaves looks like a balloon. Colorful and catches the eye, but not much substance. [i]That doesn’t preclude having some fun, though.[/i]
		*goto ending
	#How can I make a good impression on Margot so I can keep this job?
		*set boss_regard +1
		The clump of leaves looks like a wreath. Achievements that are earned. [i]I suppose doing everything right during today’s investigation would be a start.[/i]
		*goto ending

You ponder the morning’s oracles as you head into work.
