Rene finishes reading first. $!{ihe} whistles and waves, leaving you and Margot in the conference room.

Margot clears her throat.

	“Margot, This a weird coincidence, but I actually know the person I’m supposed to investigate today.”

	“I know, I saw you talking to him yesterday.”

You don’t need that long with the case records, since you read most of the material just yesterday.

	It’s strange to read through Jamie’s emails, especially the ones from Bobby. $!{eHe}’s dubious, then worried, then angry about some investments that Jamie sold ${ehis} parents. Strangely, the amount of his incoming and outgoing emails per day dropped dramatically recently.
	*goto Margot_leaving
*else
	Person C turns out to be a company recruiter named Edgar Yee. You remember his solid work history and good coworker relationships, now threatened by a drinking problem. Flipping through the binder, you see typical parental emails to his kids, both in college, and knock-down-drag-out fights with his soon-to-be-ex wife. On a lighter note, it seems that his coworkers all enjoy the assorted swag and give-aways that he brings back from career fairs.

Rene stops you as you pass by ${ihis} office.

“You have to try one of these chocolate covered apricots from Turkey,” ${ihe} says. “Fortify yourself so you’ll be extra sharp when you go poking around today.”

“It’s been interesting so far,” you say.

“I think the tricky part is making a decision about whether SEKA was right or wrong to flag concern about a situation. I mean, you saw yesterday how there are so many well-intentioned employees, who find themselves in a messy situation through no fault of their own. The artificial intelligence is right to notice that kind of stuff, so Ubiquity can attention and help people like Tonya and Jason. Those are genuinely good situations for SEKA to flag.”

“Sure.”

“I know you and Margot both see how much SEKA can benefit Ubiquity, if we can just get it tuned up. Surely Margot wouldn’t be trying to use it to solve this security breach problem if she didn’t believe the software worked.”

$!{ihe} offers you the dish of treats again.

	You agree. SEKA does seem to mostly notice real issues.

“Oh yes, and if you do find the person who’s been sabotaging Ubiquity’s computer system, management would be quite impressed. They’d probably give you a permanent position and end your probation period early. Good luck!”

*page_break
You know Bobby doesn’t like to talk on the phone, but since ${ehe} dragged you to the coffee shop yesterday, you feel justified calling ${ehim} today. $!{ehe} answers on the first ring.

“Look, I’m sorry Jamie was so set against me living with an ex, but I thought you came up with a great temporary solution, so let’s see how that goes.”

“I’m not calling about the housemate situation! Here’s the story. I found out that something is going on at work, and they’re investigating Jamie. I’m not involved and I just don’t want you to get mad at me if it turns out they find some stuff.”

“What? Is this about his investment pyramid scheme thing with Reliable Trust? He’s already got my parents losing money with his ridiculous investments. He told me he was going to keep it completely separate from work and not even pitch it to coworkers.”

“I don’t know exactly what it’s about. But do you believe me? I’m not trying to mess things up for Jamie at work. I’m totally staying out of it.”

“You shouldn’t stay out of it! You should help him.”

“You just said he might be selling bogus investments to people. You want me to help?”

“Not help him sell bad investments. I don’t know. Just make sure people understand that he’s not trying to rip anyone off. He honestly believes they’re great investments, and he’s not doing it at work anyways.”

“I don’t know if I can do anything to help.”

“Just promise you’ll try!”
