Before you can say anything else, the President of Ubiquity comes running into the room. He’s got a couple of security guard with him, and they’re all out of breath.

“Thank you, folks, why don’t you all take the rest of the day off,” the President gasps between huffing and puffing. “We’ve been monitoring the situation, and have it completely under control. No need to go back to your office, we’ll pick up anything you need and then walk you out.” He gasps some more. “Now that I think about it, maybe you’d better just go on a short vacation while we take care of a few details. You can all expect to hear from me soon. Don’t worry about coming back to work until then.”

The three of you are bustled out of the building, and the President himself takes your badges and keys. “Just a little precaution, nothing to be alarmed about. Don’t call us, I’ll call you.”

You part ways with Margot and Rene. Awkward. “Uh, see you around. Or not, I guess,” you say. They seem just as confused as you are.
