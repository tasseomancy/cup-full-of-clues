You arrive at work prepared, carrying muffins and coffee for the team, and with granola bars in your backpack.

Margot hands out another set of binders which are all chained together. “Here are the case records that have the real names of all parties. These binders will remain locked in this room; do you understand? Read what you need to read now, and come back later if you have a question.”

*if A_choice = 1
	*comment (If you picked Person A for investigation, you are assign him.)
	“Casey, here’s the file on Person A. You’ll be on him today.”

	Inside the binder, Person A’s name is written in big letter. JAMIE TRAVERS.
	*goto reveal
*else
	*comment (Otherwise, Margot gets him, and you get Person C.)
	“Casey, here’s the file on Person C. You’ll be on him today. I’m taking Person A myself.”

	As she opens her binder, you can’t help glancing over and seeing Person A’s name in big letters. [b]JAMIE TRAVERS.[/b]

Jamie Travers! You’re living with one of the people being investigated. Your team thinks that Jamie’s either deliberately or accidentally responsible for some of the recent cyber attacks against Ubiquity.

[i]What do I do now? Things are sure going to be awkward with Bobby if ${ehe} thinks I got ${ehis} boyfriend investigated for some kind of cyber crime.[/i]

What do you want to do?
*choice
	#Protect Jamie from getting in trouble.
		*set case_2_goal 1
		*if A_choice = 1
			You know Jamie, and you know he wouldn’t deliberately sabotage Ubiquity. Maybe SEKA is just wrong about him acting like a bad guy at all, or maybe he’s made some security mistakes. Since you’re leading the investigation, you’ll do your best to protect him from being blamed.
			*finish
		*else
			You know Jamie, and you know he wouldn’t deliberately sabotage Ubiquity. Maybe SEKA is just wrong about him acting like a bad guy at all, or maybe he’s made some security mistakes. You’ll have a talk with him, just so he knows to cooperate with Margot.
			*finish
	#Use your relationship with Jamie to get more truthful information out of him for the investigation.
		*set case_2_goal 2
		*if A_choice = 1
			You’re in luck. Since you’re living with Jamie, and he trusts you, you’ll be able to get to the bottom of why SEKA flagged him.
			*finish
		*else
			Since you’re living with Jamie, and he trusts you, you’ll be able to get to the bottom of why SEKA flagged him. You’ll just casually mention Jamie to Margot, not letting on that you peeked at her binder. That’ll give her the opportunity to invite you to help with the investigation.
			*finish
	#Distance yourself from the investigation, so Bobby and Jamie can’t blame you for whatever happens.
		*set case_2_goal 3
		*if A_choice = 1
			Before you read any further, you need to get Margot to take you off this assignment. You don’t want to be the one that Jamie and Bobby blame, if he gets in trouble over some security breaches. Maybe you’d also better talk to Bobby too, so ${ehe}’ll know you aren’t involved in the investigation.
			*finish
		*else
			Since Margot will be leading the investigation into Jamie’s activities, you should be able to keep your name out of it. But wait - Jamie already knows you’re working with Margot. Would Jamie believe Margot if she told him that you weren’t involved on his case? Maybe Bobby would believe you if you talked to ${ehim} before the investigation goes much further.
			*finish
	#Get Jamie into trouble so he won’t have any time to fuss about you and Bobby living together.
		*set case_2_goal 4
		*if A_choice = 1
			You’re in luck. Since you’re in charge of his investigation, you can make sure to find enough suspicious activity to keep Jamie too busy to object when you propose to go back to your original housemate setup with Bobby. 
			*finish
		*else
			You don’t want to admit to Margot that you peeked at her binder, but how else can you help her find some suspicious activity in her investigations? Maybe if you find anything incriminating in Jamie’s bedroom and papers, you can get Rene to help make sure it’s included in the case record compiled by SEKA. Margot notices everything important in the case records.
