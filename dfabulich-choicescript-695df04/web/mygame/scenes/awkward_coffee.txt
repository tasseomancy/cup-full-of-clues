Your phone rings. It’s Bobby, who never calls.

“Casey, we need to talk right away! Meet me at the coffee shop down the street in 15 minutes. It’s really important.”

Before you can say anything, ${ehe} hangs up. You text ${ehim}, but ${ehe} doesn’t respond. You’ve got less than an hour before your meeting with Margot and Rene at 3pm.

What do you do?
*choice
	#Go straight to the coffee shop. Bobby must be in trouble. 
		*set boss_regard -1
		You’re sure to annoy Margot if you’re late getting back, but Bobby wouldn’t be so insistent if it wasn’t an emergency.
		*goto shop
	#Tell Margot where you’re going. She’ll understand.
		Margot isn’t thrilled, but since you’ve already written up summaries of your candidates, she says she won’t start calling to look for you until 3:30pm. 
		*goto shop
	#Ask Rene to cover for you if you’re late getting back. Maybe ${ihe} can just go first presenting ${ihis} assessments. 
		*set resist_colleague -1
		Rene agrees that you should go talk to your friend now, and assures you that he’ll smooth things over with Margot if you’re late to the meeting.
		*goto shop

Bobby’s waiting for you and doesn’t even let you order any coffee before pulling you into the back of the shop. 

“Why did you tell Jamie that we used to date? Now he’s insisting that either I kick you out of our apartment or I move into his condo!”

“I just assumed he knew. Were you trying to keep it a secret?”
*line_break
“Not exactly. Our history just never really came up.”
*line_break
“How could I never come up? He sees me around all the time. He helped me get a job interview at Ubiquity!”
*line_break
“He knows we’ve known each other a long time, he just didn’t know the details. We weren’t even dating that long, and you know I always thought it was a mistake to go out with a housemate.”
*line_break
“Are you saying I didn’t count because you never wanted to date me in the first place?”
*line_break
“Can we not have this argument for the millionth time about whether we’re just better as friends? We need to figure out who has to move out of our apartment!”
*line_break
“How about neither of us moves out of our apartment, and Jamie minds his own business about who you want to live with?”
*line_break
“You can’t say it’s unreasonable for him to care if I’m still living with an ex.”
*line_break
“If that’s what you think, why didn’t you tell him about us before?”

*page_break
After an hour of arguing, nothing is resolved. 

[i]Feels like old times - this is exactly how it was back when we were dating![/i] 

You tell Bobby that you have to get back to work, and ${ehe} asks what you want to do. You suggest that:
*choice
	#Bobby can stay at Jamie’s place for a while, to see if ${ehe} likes it.
		*set housemate_choice 1
		Bobby reminds you that ${ehe} works for ${ehis} parents, and that they would have a cow if ${ehe} moved in with ${ehis} boyfriend. Plus, ${ehe}’s not sure they’re really that serious yet, so ${ehe} doesn’t even want to live with Jamie. $!{ehe} decides that the two of you should both talk with Jamie tonight to figure out a solution.
		*goto leave
	#Bobby invites Jamie to move in with the two of you for a while, so he can tell that there’s really nothing going on between you and Bobby.
		*set housemate_choice 2
		*set housemate_relationship +1
		Bobby hugs you and declares your idea to be brilliant. $!{ehe}’ll talk to Jamie about it right away.
		*goto leave
	#You can just camp out at work temporarily, until Jamie comes to his senses.
		*set housemate_choice 3
		Bobby is dubious that Ubiquity will let you do that, plus ${ehe} doesn’t want to be in charge of your cat while you’re not home. $!{ehe} decides that the two of you should both talk with Jamie tonight to figure out a solution.
		*goto leave
	#You and your cat can go stay with Jamie, until he gets sick of the idea.
		*set housemate_relationship +1
		*set housemate_choice 4
		Bobby hugs you and declares your idea to be brilliant. $!{ehe}’ll talk to Jamie about it right away. 
		*goto leave

You rush back to work, bringing back coffee and muffins.
