	“I can’t let you just go home thinking about how overwhelming the job is,” Rene insists. 
	
	“You’d talk yourself out of coming back, and then where would that leave us? As a favor to the ${iguy} who would be left as Margot’s only minion if you quit, I’m begging you to give me a chance to help end your day with a something more delicious than microwave burritos.”

	You text Bobby to let ${ehim} know that Rene will be coming over for burgers. When you get home, ${ehe} and Jamie have the grill already fired up and the food ready to go. Rene presents them with a bottle of wine. 
	
	[i]Has ${ihe} been carrying that around in ${ihis} bag all day? I wonder if ${ihe} can pull a rabbit out of someone’s ear?[/i]

The burgers come out perfect. Rene gets everyone laughing when ${ihe} tries to juggle the ketchup, mustard, and a burger, taking bites from the moving target. After the party breaks up, you walk ${ihim} out to ${ihis} car.

“You know, Margot really understands how much SEKA can help Ubiquity. It’s not just about finding people doing something wrong. It’s about getting Ubiquity to notice when and where it needs to give its employees a hand.”

“You mean things like helping Tonya stave off obsessed fans, or dealing with Jason’s wrong phone number calls.”
*line_break
“Exactly. There’s so much good that SEKA can do for Ubiquity, if we can just convince management to be patient while we’re adjusting the artificial intelligence. I’m afraid they expect SEKA to work perfectly as soon as it’s installed, which is completely impossible!”
*line_break
“Yeah, people can be impatient.”

Rene clasps your shoulder. “I knew I could count on you.” 

$!{ihe} gets into his car and rolls down the window. 

“With all three of us working together, I’m sure we can keep Ubiquity management from killing the SEKA deployment project!”

The restaurant is crowded, but you and Rene are ushered to seats at a table in the corner.

“It must be interesting working with all the different customer companies to get SEKA trained up right,” you say.

“It’s so different at each customer site. Margot, and Ubiquity, have been great. She really understands the SEKA system, and why it’s necessary to do a lot of manual investigation in the beginning, to tune the artificial intelligence. I just hope she doesn’t quit before the SEKA rollout project is finished.”
*line_break
“How long does the tuning take?
*line_break
“With a large organization like Ubiquity, a place that has a lot of different types of products and departments, it could take up to six months. But the pace of investigations is much higher right at the beginning, and the last couple months are more like fine tuning and carrying out a few followup recommendations from SEKA. Most companies find that the investigation team naturally transitions into a problem solving team.
*line_break
“You mean doing things like helping Tonya stave off obsessed fans, or dealing with Jason’s wrong phone number calls.”
*line_break
“Exactly - by the time Ubiquity can trust SEKA to identify the rare employees who are doing something wrong, Ubiquity can also trust SEKA to flag problem situations that need intervention.”

Your food arrives, and the entree you ordered turns out to be an unusual bowl of noodles. There’s a mixture of thick and thin noodles of different colors, and there are strange things in the soup that might be vegetables or might be animal parts. You try not to slurp or splash too much.

“There’s so much good that SEKA can do for Ubiquity, if Margot and I can just convince management to be patient while we’re adjusting the artificial intelligence. I’m afraid they expect SEKA to work perfectly as soon as it’s installed, which is completely impossible!”

“Yeah, people expect to be living in the future with smart software systems.”

“SEKA really is amazingly smart, but it just needs a training period to understand a new customer organization. Casey, can we count on you to help?”
