You feel yourself drifting off to sleep. Your future stretches in front of you like a vast forest of question marks, obscured by fog. 

[i]If only I could perform real divinations! Seeing the future and reading people’s minds would be awesome. I could do anything I wanted.[/i]

Suddenly, you’re in a bright room you’ve never seen before. Pillars stretch upward, holding up a sky blue dome. In the middle of the room, you see a table draped in purple velvet. Small cushions cradling four unfamiliar artifacts are lined up across the table.

*page_break
You approach the table, footsteps echoing loudly. On the left side is a shining golden bell with a heart-shaped handle. Next is an antique copper hand mirror, pitted with black tarnish. Third in line is a clear crystal bowl filled with a bubbling green liquid. On the right side is a grubby, tattered stuffed bunny.

When you reach the table, you pick up the artifact that calls out to you.

The golden bell swings easily in your hand, like it was waiting for you. The sound of the ringing gets louder and louder, transforming into the massed voices of a triumphant choir, before fading to mystical chanting. Finally, whispering voices surround you. 

“I heard that she’s worried.”

“There’s always been something odd about him.”

“Remember what happened at the last place they worked?”

“Everyone’s older and wiser now, but do you think that will be enough?”

Along the bottom edge of the bell, you see an inscription: “Rumors are siblings to the truth. Listen for them.”

The surface of the mirror is as tarnished and pitted as the frame. You tilt it, catching the light, and a shape seems to move across the mirror’s face. It swirls, dividing into two comets spiraling around each other. When they collide in the middle, the mirror’s surface flashes with bright light, and you see faces looking out at you.

As you watch, the one face beams at you. Another looks surprised. One cries silently, and one glares and sticks its tongue out.

Around the edge of the mirror, you see an inscription: “Glimpses of soul bring insight. Look for them.”

The bowl is cold and your hands shake as you lift it closer to your face. You smell medicinal herbs and hear the liquid fizzing. Now a green mist swirls above the surface, and sparks fly out of the bowl. The liquid burns your throat, and as you swallow, the taste in your month changes from bitter to sweet.

Around the rim of the bowl, you see an inscription: “Conversation leads to answers. Ask questions when you need information.”

As soon as you touch the bunny, memories float through your head.

The people change in each scene, but the bunny looks the same.

You almost drop the stuffed bunny when it wiggles its nose and speaks. “The past leads to the present and future. You’ll understand when you know what came before.”

...the stuffed bunny, lying motionless on your bed. You never had a stuffed bunny, but here it is, clearly well-loved, with the soft fabric nearly worn through.
