Margot quickly reviews her list, steamrolling over any opinions you or Rene offer. 

“That’s three top candidates for investigation tomorrow, one for each of us.” Margot says. “Get a good night’s sleep - it’s going to be a long day.”

Rene suggests going out for drinks, but you need to go deal with your housemate situation.
