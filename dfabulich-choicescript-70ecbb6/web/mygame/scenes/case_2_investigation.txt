When you get to Jamie's office, he's telling some of his coworkers about your cat, and everyone’s showing each other cat pictures.

“Here’s Casey now! This is ${phis} first week at Ubiquity.” Everyone introduces themselves, and you joke around with the group before people head back to their computers.
*page_break
“Jamie, I’ve got a question for you.”
*line_break
“Is this about a secret project? You’d better be careful not to tell me anything, or you’ll have to kill me.”
*line_break
“I’m not joking, this could be a problem for you.”
*line_break
“For me? Is this about Bobby?”
*line_break
“No, it’s about IT issues. You know, malware, viruses.”

He looks completely confused. You go on. “Has anything strange been happening with your computer lately?”

“I don’t know why you’re the one asking, but I have noticed a few things.”
*page_break
Jamie explains that about two weeks ago, he noticed he was getting a lot less email from people outside Ubiquity. The same thing was happening to his entire group. They assumed that Ubiquity had switched to a different spam filtering system that must be dropping a bunch of their real emails. When they complained, the IT people insisted that there hadn’t been any change in Ubiquity spam filtering, and weren’t able to explain or fix the problem.

“So what did you do?”

“Everyone just started using their personal gmail accounts, or other kinds of email accounts they could access from work. It was a pain trying to find all the people who might have been trying to email us, thinking we were ignoring them, when actually we just weren’t getting their messages anymore. But after about a week, I think I mostly got people to stop using my Ubiquity email, and stopped missing messages. I know we’re not supposed to use check other email accounts on work computers, but we didn’t really have a choice.”

*page_break
“Anything else strange?”

“A few days ago, a bunch of us started getting weird pop-up messages. Some other people had their machines get super slow.”

*if (case_2_goal = 1) and (A_choice = 2)
	"Look, I know you’re just trying to do your job, but obviously people in the group have been getting viruses, probably from messages in their other emails accounts.

“Sounds like a hassle.”

	“Sounds like everyone got some malware, maybe from sharing bad flashdrives.”

	Edgar shakes his head. “But all the flashdrives were brand-new giveaways from the exhibit hall. Those companies wouldn’t be giving away bad drives.”

	“They might not know, or might not notice if someone puts back a couple after modifying them,” you point out.
