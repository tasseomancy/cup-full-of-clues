After she shows you your new office, you and Margot sit down in a small conference room decorated with paper lanterns, waiting for the rest of the team. 

“The first thing you need to know is that the real purpose of our team is a secret. Only a few people at Ubiquity know that we’re not just the Taskforce to Improve Efficiency. It’s critical that you stick to the cover story. If you think that’s going to be a problem, tell me now, and we’ll transfer you to another group.”

“I can handle that,” you say.

“Good. Here’s Rene now. $!{ihe}’s the other member of our team, but ${ihe} doesn’t work for Ubiquity. $!{ihe}’s with the company that makes the SEKA software. SEKA stands for See Everything, Know All.”

A young ${iman} with wavy hair and dimples comes into the room and shuts the door. “Casey, it’s good to meet you. I’m Rene and I’m looking forward to working with you.” As you shake ${ihis} hand, you can’t help smiling back, even though you still have no idea what your super-secret job is going to be.

Margot checks her phone and purses her lips, muttering an obscenity. 

“Rene, since you’re the expert on SEKA, why don’t you sit with Casey and explain the purpose of our team. I’ve got to go pick up today’s info dump; looks like we’ll be busy. Be back soon.”

As she gets up, you notice she’s carrying three file folders labeled “urgent” “epic” and “really weird”.

Rene moves to the chair next to you, and pulls it away from the table so ${ihe}’s looking into your eyes. 

“This group is a bit hush-hush because Ubiquity has just installed See Everything, Know All, or SEKA. SEKA is the newest technology for automatically monitoring all employee activities, and automatically identifying thieves, blackmailers, or other bad guys who are hurting the organization.”

“How does that even work?” you interrupt.

*page_break
$!{ihe} leans closer and lowers ${ihis} voice. 

“It’s amazing artificial intelligence. Think of it as finding a needle in a field of haystacks, using powerful X-rays and magnets, so you don’t even have to bother touching most of the haystacks. Once we get SEKA’s settings adjusted exactly right, Ubiquity will be much more secure and efficient, which is why our team is officially known as the Taskforce to Improve Efficiency. It’s not all about finding bad guys. It’s also for finding other problems that need attention.”

That sounds great, but you’ve got another burning question:

“Oh no, no. Since it’s all automated, unlike most of the other monitoring systems on the market, you don’t need a team of people actually digging through everyone’s activity logs all the time. Once we get it working right, I’ll be off to another customer site, and it’ll be running by itself. People like you and Margot will only be called in for rare cases when a human needs to take a closer look at someone who’s been flagged by SEKA.”

“We need to help teach SEKA the range of normal behavior here at Ubiquity, so SEKA gets better at identifying real bad guys. We’ll go talk to the Ubiquity employees that SEKA thinks are acting strange, and help SEKA understand whether they’re unusual for innocent reasons, or strange because they’re criminals.”
*finish

*label dunno
“I’m delighted that Ubiquity picked you as my colleague, but I’m afraid I don’t know how they decided. It’s certainly been busy enough that Margot wanted another person on our team. The last person washed out after a few days, but I’m sure you’ll be a much better fit.”
*finish

*label evade
Rene stops smiling for a minute. 

“Oh, you know how tricky it can be to get any kind of software set up, even something as advanced as SEKA. Technology can be so fussy. But now that we have you on the team, I’m sure things will improve!”
