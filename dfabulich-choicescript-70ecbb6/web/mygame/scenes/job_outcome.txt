The doorbell wakes you up. You throw on some clothes and answer the door. It’s Margot, who’s actually smiling. “I brought donuts.”

You put the coffee pot on. Margot tells you that the President of Ubiquity is busy negotiating a financial settlement from the company that makes SEKA, but asked her to give you the good news. Your investigation uncovered serious problems caused by SEKA, which Rene was trying to help cover up. Ubiquity is skipping the rest of your probationary period and hiring you for a permanent job immediately.
*page_break
“But if Ubiquity is dumping SEKA, they won’t need us to tune up the artificial intelligence anymore.”

“Oh, our Taskforce on Improving Efficiency will now be reporting directly to the President, and trying to fix Ubiquity’s most critical problems. I’ve been promoted and we’ll be getting a few new people for the team. I’ll be counting on you to help them get the hang of it.”

The doorbell wakes you up. You answer the door in your pajamas. It’s Margot, who’s almost smiling. “I brought donuts.”

Your investigation uncovered serious problems caused by SEKA, which Rene was trying to help cover up.

On Monday, the doorbell wakes you up. You can’t find your bathrobe and haven’t brushed your teeth. It’s Margot, who’s not exactly smiling, but at least isn’t glaring at you.

	Which is better than you’d expect, since your last interaction was to accuse her of sabotaging Ubiquity.

Margot tells you that you’ll need to do better to pass the probationary evaluation, but she thinks you’ve got some potential. You’ll still be in her group, but Rene will be gone.

“Will we still be working on the SEKA rollout investigations, or is Ubiquity dumping it?”

“You don’t need to know the details, but the Taskforce on Improving Efficiency will be looking into other issues. Hopefully you’ll become a real asset to the team.”

On Monday, the doorbell wakes you up. You can’t find your bathrobe and haven’t brushed your teeth. It’s the HR woman from your interview.

She tells you that you’ll need to do better to pass the probationary evaluation, but that Ubiquity has decided to give you a chance at another assignment. You’ll meet your new boss when you report to work tomorrow. They’ll be keeping a close eye on you with monthly performance evaluations. 
*page_break

She completely ignores your question. “I’m sorry to hear that your first assignment didn’t turn out very well. Hopefully you’ll be a better fit with the new team.”

The doorbell wakes you up. You jump out of bed, trip over your cat, and end up with leftover burrito in your hair. The HR woman from your interview is at the door.

She tells you that Ubiquity is terminating your employment immediately.

“But what happened with Margot and Rene, and the President of Ubiquity?”
