That evening, you and your housemate (and ex-${egirlfriend}), Bobby, take turns microwaving frozen burritos. $!{ehe} looks about as tired as you feel.

“So…do you think you’ll get the job?” ${ehe} asks. “Jamie tried to put in a good word for you.”

After almost a year of job hunting, applying to every open position you could find, you can’t help being jealous. Jamie had offers from all the hottest technology companies, including Ubiquity, before graduation. Bobby was working in ${ehis} family’s import business. You, on the other hand, with a degree in modern literature and work experience doing tarot card readings for gullible tourists, had not gotten a single offer.

	#“I appreciate his help. And thank you for suggesting it to him in the first place; I know he wasn’t sure there’d be anything I could do at a place like Ubiquity. Most people wouldn't see anything in my work history that's a match, but I can pick out a thread.”

		Bobby sighs. “Things at my parents’ company aren’t looking so good. If we can’t find some new customers soon, my whole family might be looking for different jobs soon.”

		“I hope it works out,” you say. “Your parents made it through the last recession.” 
		
		$!{ehe} nods.

	#“I’ve heard Ubiquity’s pretty selective and everyone comes away thinking they failed the interview. I've been reading the online rumor mill forums.”

You sigh.

“Maybe they won’t try calling my references. My Mom’s going to be out of touch all month, and my former boss at that frozen yogurt cafe isn’t my biggest fan.”

“You never told me what went wrong at the frozen yogurt place,” Bobby says.

Bobby rolls ${ehis} eyes. “Classy all the way, huh? Hope you won't have a repeat of that.” “It was a long time ago! Before college!” you offer.

Bobby starts to clean up. “Oh, and Casey…can you figure out how to get your cat to stop shredding my couch?”

Lying in bed, you can’t stop wondering. [i]What if I don’t get this job? How am I going to pay Bobby back for the last three month’s rent? Maybe I don’t have any marketable talents and should just move back in with Mom, and join her bogus fortune telling business.[/i]
